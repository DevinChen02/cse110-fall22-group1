## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations: ##
- Members who have a preferred name or nickname that they would go by, will add it on slack in parenthesis after their actual/full name, e.g. Aleksandra (Ola) Desens.
- All members will be expected to read slack messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and leave a üëçüèª to mark the message as read in no more than 12 hours.

## Scheduling Meetings: ##
- All members agree to attend weekly, in-person meetings on Wednesdays at 1:00-2:00pm. If the above time becomes difficult for anyone in the team to attend, the meeting will be rescheduled to its default time, on Wednesdays at 8:00-9:00pm.
- Any additional meetings may be scheduled by any member of the team, in-person or virtually as needed. Members are not required to attend them but will do their best to do so.
- For any virtual meetings, person organizing it will post a zoom link in #general channel on slack for easy access.

## General Responsibilites for All Team Members: ##
- All members agree to perform tasks assigned to them to the best of their abilities.
- All members agree to complete their tasks in a timely manner and communicate any issues that may impact timely delivery as soon as possible.


## Conflict Resolution: ##
- If a member is not reacting or responding to slack messages posted by other members within 12 hours from posting, the team agrees to delegate one person to send a direct message to check on that person. If the issue persists or repeats itself, the team agrees to bring it up to a TA.
- If a member is communicating the possibility of not meeting a deadline, the team agrees to help to the best of their time and abilities.
- If a member did not meet a deadline and did not reach out for help, they will get one warning before bringing the issue up to a TA.

## Expectations of Faculty: ##
- If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff (a TA or professor), but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment.
