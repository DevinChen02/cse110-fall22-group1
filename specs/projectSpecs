# Brainstorming project details - Sharable Grocery List:

## Project Evolution

### First Stage 
  * Personal grocery list
  * List view + sidebar with list of users (currently active and inactive) in the account
  * Priority items
  * Categories for items by store isles - default and custom 
  * Adding/removing items directly to and from categories
  * Show only unchecked items (yet to be purchased)

### Next Stage
  * Household account to share grocery list between users
  * Manual input of total cost of the groceries purchased
  * Possibility to adjust cost split by different fractions (not necessarily 50/50)
  * Points getting the groceries (by number of items bought) to help even the efforts between users
  
### Maybe (?)
  * Email notifications about changes made and what items have been added or checked off  
  * Private website with password prtected access to grocery list - only users with password can access it.
